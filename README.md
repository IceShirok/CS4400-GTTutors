YJFC-Budget-Tool
================

A small budget tool made to keep track of YJFC monetary transactions.

The program is generic enough to be used for any clubs in general, but let it be known that it was first programmed by a YJFC member. :D

TODOs:
* Make Ant or Maven build file.
* Get stuff working.
* Learn how to JavaFX.
* Learn how to code better.

This tool is planned to have the following features:
* This tool will be run on a standalone Java application.
* Data will be stored in an SQLite database.
* Login is required to access the application. Not sure whether to allow the application manager to directly access the database.
* Committees can fill in their budget request forms of expected expenses and enter it into the database.
* Users can view SGA money allocations by year.
* Users can enter in their transaction of money spent, earned, and whether SGA reimbursements will come.
* Users can view and save summaries of budgets by: year, by committee/category, by a weekly report, and by actual vs. expected.
* Users can view the expected amount of money vs. the actual amount of money in the bank. Due to security reasons, the actual money amount must be manually updated.

This tool may also include the following features:
* Excel parser tool. Requires standardization of Excel spreadsheets.
* GUI for database admin to manage the database better.
